    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro">I grew up in a small town in Minnesota as a child, and it was a wonderful experience. We had a sense of community and a friendly atmosphere that welcomed everyone. One of my favorite hobbies growing up was dance, which I started at a young age and continued throughout my childhood. </p>
    <p>I also loved playing soccer, and the town had a great youth league that provided a fun and competitive environment. Of course, being in Minnesota, we had plenty of opportunities to play in the snow, whether building snow forts, sledding down hills or skiing. These hobbies helped teach me the value of hard work, teamwork, and having fun.</p>
    <p>I moved to Arizona during high school, and that was an exciting but nerve-wracking experience. Leaving behind familiar surroundings and family and starting over in a new place was a challenge, but I was able to quickly make friends and found a great support system. <span class="sentence">Continuing dance in Arizona was important, and luckily, my school had a great company and dance team. </span> </p>
    <p>After high school, I attended Northern Arizona University to pursue a career in pharmacy. I am passionate about helping people, and pharmacy seemed the perfect career path. After taking some time away from university, I realized that I have a true passion for technology and decided to pursue a degree in Software Development. </p>
