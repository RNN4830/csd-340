        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro">I grew up in a small town in <span id = "Minnesota">_________</span>  as a child, and it was a wonderful experience. We had a sense of community and a friendly atmosphere that welcomed everyone. One of my favorite hobbies growing up was dance, which I started at a young age and continued throughout my childhood. </p>
        <p>I also loved playing soccer, and the town had a great youth league that provided a fun and competitive environment. Of course, being in Minnesota, we had plenty of <span id = "opportunities">_________</span> to play in the snow, whether building snow forts, sledding down hills or skiing. These hobbies helped teach me the value of hard work, teamwork, and having fun.</p>
        <p>I moved to Arizona during high school, and that was an exciting but nerve-wracking experience. Leaving behind familiar surroundings and family and starting over in a new place was a <span id = "challenge">_________</span>, but I was able to quickly make friends and found a great support system. <span id="replaceText" class="sentence">Continuing dance in Arizona was important, and luckily, my school had a great company and dance team. </span> </p>
        <p>After high school, I attended Northern Arizona University to pursue a career in pharmacy. I am passionate about helping people, and pharmacy seemed the perfect career path. After taking some time away from university, I realized that I have a true passion for <span id = "technology">_________</span> and decided to pursue a degree in Software Development. </p>
